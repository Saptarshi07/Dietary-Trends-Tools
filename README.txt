2) Save all the csvs in the same folder as master folder (i.e the folder of which contains this README file)

3) Assure that the python package of pandas is installed. Here is the link for it: https://pandas.pydata.org

4) Work with the python file - run.py for generating land-spared vs years results for food group - continent pairs. Instructions on how to do that is provided in run.py. A sample python notebook named test.ipynb (included in master) is also included for better understanding of some/all functions in dietary_faotools.py

5) Work with the python file - run_country.py for generating land-spared vs years results for food-group-country pairs.  Instructions on how to do that is provided in run_country.py.
